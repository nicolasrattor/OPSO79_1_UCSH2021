  abstract = {International comparative research has found that strike incidence is higher where two or more unions bargain with an employer (``multi-unionism''), as is common in most European countries, than where only one union does, all else equal. Two proposed explanations for this relationship, both invoking inter-union rivalry as the main dynamic, are that under multi-unionism, unions (a) make propagandistic use of strikes to attract members, or (b) compete with each other by bidding up bargaining demands. To date, the evidence bearing on these hypotheses has been equivocal because, the author argues, researchers have focused on activity at the national level rather than at the lower levels that are more commonly the nexus for strike formation. The author performs empirical tests using industry-sector-level data for seven European countries for the years 1990\textendash 2006, and finds evidence clearly favoring the competitive bargaining hypothesis over the propaganda hypothesis.},

The author argues that job growth in developing countries through outsourcing to competing firms has often actually resulted in declining unionization and lower wage rates relative to traditional, integrated manufacturing firms. Using time-series data on union membership from 1980\textendash 2003 for Honduras and El Salvador as well as 2004 Household Survey Data for El Salvador, he examines the determinants of unionization rates and wages in the manufacturing sectors. He finds that that competitive outsourcing hurts labor at the plant-level in three ways: 1) it reduces labor's strike leverage by geographically dispersing the production process; 2) it increases the threat of plant mobility by decreasing plant-level investments; and 3) it increases labor costs relative to total costs, which creates an incentive for employers to keep wages low and unions out.},

Decomposing pay into worker and firm fixed effects, we then document that the LFWP can be largely explained by a rise in firm effects with firm size. The dramatic decline is due a reduction in these firm effects at large firms. These changes have been concentrated at very large employers. In contrast, worker composition has changed little. We also find the majority of the change occurs within industries.},

To explore the origin of the premium, I construct a simple bargaining model from which I derive three predictions, which are tested empirically using matched employer\textendash employee data. The main prediction is that if intra-firm bargaining is behind the union wage premium, the latter increases with the amount of quasi-rents available in the firms that unions organise. This prediction is validated empirically when firms' market shares are used as a proxy for their rents.},

The econometric model is estimated separately for five skill groups using a large panel data set formed from the U.S. Current Population Survey. The results suggest that unions raise wages more for workers with lower levels of observed skills. In addition, the patterns of selection bias differ by skill group. Among workers with lower levels of observed skill, unionized workers are positively selected, whereas union workers are negatively selected from among those with higher levels of observed skill.}

The model offers predictions on the nature of union selection, which are examined empirically. Data on union certification elections, matched with data on establishment characteristics, are used to explore where union activity is concentrated.},

The share of a firm's employees covered can vary between 0\% and 100\%, suggesting that researchers should distinguish union density, coverage at the firm level, and coverage at the individual level. Using linked employer-employee data, the authors estimate OLS and quantile regressions of wages on these dimensions of union influence. They find that a higher share of employees in a firm covered by industrywide or firm-specific contracts is associated with higher wages but find no clear-cut effect on wage dispersion. Yet, holding coverage at the firm level constant, individual coverage is associated with lower wages and less wage dispersion. Higher union density reinforces the effects of coverage. But for employees in firms without coverage, density's effect is negative and thus compresses the wage distribution in firms without coverage.},

The data also show that dispersion in average wages is narrower among organized plants, but by more modest amounts than the within-establishment differential. Overall, the evidence suggests a major role for explicit union wage policies in explaining the dispersion of wages within firms and in the economy as a whole.},

  abstract = {How economic segmentation generates income inequality constitutes a central question for theories of economic and social organization and of socioeconomic achievement. Previous research emphasizes two sources of the structural variation in income: (1) employers with large amounts of resources, for a variety of reasons, may find it in their interests to pay workers higher wages; and (2) some workers are able to acquire power against their employers as well as against other workers and can therefore extract higher earnings. In this paper, we investigate several issues involved in the links among economic segmentation, worker power, and income inequality. We argue that the structure of economic segmentation is multidimensional and reflects such distinct concepts as concentration, economic scale, state intervention in the market, capital intensity, and organization size. Worker power also is derived from diverse sources, such as union membership, occupational skill and licensing, class position, and tenure with an employer. We construct measures of these two sets of concepts and examine their relationships and effects on income with data from two national samples of individuals. We also relate economic segmentation to issues raised by the socioeconomic achievement literature; in particular, we find that the effect of education on income differs among firm and industrial contexts. Our analyses illustrate the utility of an economic segmentation approach for explaining structural sources of income inequality.}

  abstract = {Jobs differ along many dimensions including firm size. The wage gap due to firm size of 35\% is comparable to the gender wage gap of 36\% for men over women and greater than the wage gap of 14\% for whites over black employees. The size-wage premium is larger for men and varies across industries. It is larger in the US than in other industrialized countries. Large firms demand a higher quality of labor defined by such observable characteristics as education, job tenure, and a higher fraction of full-time workers. Part 3 examines three behavioral explanations. (1) Productive employees are matched with able entrepreneurs to minimize the sum of wages and monitoring costs. (2) Big firms pay efficiency wages to deter shirking. (3) Big firms adopt a discretionary wage policy to share rents, or in Slichter's words, ``Wages over a considerable range reflect managerial discretion. When management can easily afford to pay high wages, they tend to do so.'' We advance a productivity hypothesis. A large organization sets a higher performance standard that raises labor productivity but has to be supported by a compensating wage difference. In the service industries, the pace of work depends on the customer arrival rate. The economies of massed reserves generates a positive wage-size profile. The capital/labor ratio is higher in bigger firms which also are early in adopting new technologies. Both forces raise the demand for skilled labor where skill and productivity are often unobservable traits. Production organized around teams calls for conformance to common work rules which result in paying rents to infra-marginal team members. The odds of survival are higher for big firms which enable them to ``produce'' more durable employees who are more productive because they get more training. Firm size is a function of external market forces, technology, managerial decisions, and luck. The surplus of revenues over labor costs per employee is positively related to firm size for three reasons, lower prices for non-labor inputs, possibly greater market power, or larger overhead costs to amortize the sunk costs for capital and firm -specific work force. Rent sharing cannot be dismissed as an explanation for the wage-size premium. Taxation and regulation can also affect the size distribution of firms. The organization of work and the selection of employees (whose productive traits are not always observable) are responsible for the positive relation between wages and employer size.},

The results suggest that after controlling for establishment union density a union member wage gain is only observed for the lowest level, the 1\% to 25\% density range. For the 26\% or greater establishment union density ranges the union's effect on wages is for all individuals working in the establishment and not just union members. The wage gain is 20\% for both the establishment union density ranges of 26\% to 50\% and 51\% to 75\%. Individuals working for an establishment with a greater than 75\% establishment union density achieve a wage gain of 64\%.}

In-depth interviews with union organizers and other data are used to identify the sources of radical transformation in labor organizations by comparing local unions that have substantially altered their goals and tactics with those that have changed little. This analysis highlights three factors: the occurrence of a political crisis in the local leading to new leadership, the presence of leaders with activist experience outside the labor movement who interpret the decline of labor's power as a mandate to change, and the influence of the international union in favor of innovation. The article concludes by drawing out the theoretical implications of the finding that bureaucratic conservatism can sometimes be overcome in mature social movements.}
